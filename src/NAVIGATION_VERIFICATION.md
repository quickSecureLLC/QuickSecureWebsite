## Routing Configuration

### Product Pages (12 routes)
**File:** `/components/ProductPages.tsx`  
**Router:** `/components/LiveWebsite.tsx`

All 12 product pages are mapped in `LiveWebsite.tsx`:

```typescript
const productPages: Record<string, React.ReactNode> = {
  '/product/nexus': <QuickSecureNexusPage onBack={handleBackToHome} />,
  '/product/drill': <DrillManagementPage onBack={handleBackToHome} />,
  '/product/ticketing': <TicketingSystemPage onBack={handleBackToHome} />,
  '/product/panic': <PanicButtonAppPage onBack={handleBackToHome} />,

## Navigation UX Enhancements

### Dropdown Behavior
- **Hover trigger:** Dropdowns open immediately on hover
- **Close delay:** 150ms delay before closing (prevents accidental closure)
- **Keyboard accessible:** Full keyboard navigation with focus states
- **Visual feedback:** Active state shows primary color (#006E6E) and weight 600
- **4px overlap:** Seamless transition between nav button and dropdown

### Mobile Menu
- **Accordions:** Both Products and Solutions use accordion patterns on mobile
- **Touch targets:** All links have minimum 48px height for accessibility
- **Click-outside close:** Menu closes when clicking outside
- **State management:** Products and Solutions accordions can be toggled independently

### Focus States
- **2px cyan outline** on keyboard focus (accessible)
- **Focus-visible only** (no outline on mouse click)
- **All interactive elements** have proper focus states

---

## Deleted/Removed Links

The following links have been verified as **not present** in the navigation (no dead links):

- ❌ No links to deleted design frames
- ❌ No links to deleted export pages
- ❌ No links to removed documentation
- ❌ No links to deleted components (e.g., Lightbox.tsx)

All navigation links point exclusively to:
1. Active page routes in `LiveWebsite.tsx`
2. Active component files in `/components/`
3. No external or broken references
